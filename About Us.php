        This project aims to solve an issue that all school students and their guardians face everyday, which is traffic
        and time consuming when trying to pick up their kids from school. This project will make it easier for
        guardians to pick up their kids from school by applying a way of communication between the students'
        school and their guardians through this website called WESELT. Guardians can send a notification to the
        school that is being heading to. The notification will have all the details that concern the students that are
        to
        be picked up and also a map to show the distance and time needed for guardians to arrive.
